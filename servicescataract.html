                                    <li class="leading-relaxed">Cataract refers to the clouding of the eye's natural lens, which affects the passage of light and leads to vision problems. While cataracts are often a normal part of aging, they can also result from other causes.
                                        To restore clear vision, cataract surgery is performed at the appropriate time to remove the cloudy lens. It is then replaced with an artificial lens known as an Intraocular Lens Implant (IOL). </li>

                                    <li class="leading-relaxed">Phaco-emulsification is a modern cataract surgery technique in which the eye’s natural lens is broken into tiny fragments using an ultrasonic handpiece and then gently removed. This method requires only a very small incision, typically needs few or no stitches, allows for rapid recovery, and most patients are able to return home within a few hours.
                                        At our center, we use advanced cold phaco technology—AMO Signature and Sovereign systems—known for their precision, minimal tissue damage, and consistently excellent outcomes.
                                        We offer a wide range of intraocular lens (IOL) implants, including toric and multifocal lenses, to ensure the best possible post-operative vision and improved quality of life. Our experienced counselor will guide you in selecting the most suitable lens based on your individual needs and lifestyle.

                                </div>
                                <ul class="space-y-1 text-sky-950 list-disc list-inside">
                                    <li class="leading-relaxed">During cataract surgery, one or more tiny incisions are made in the eye to allow the insertion of delicate surgical instruments. The surgeon then removes the front (anterior) portion of the capsule that holds the natural lens, providing access to the cataract.
                                        An ultrasonic handpiece called a phaco probe—equipped with a titanium or steel needle—is inserted into the eye. The tip of this needle vibrates at ultrasonic frequencies to break up (sculpt and emulsify) the cloudy lens. Simultaneously, a microprocessor-controlled pump precisely manages fluid dynamics to aspirate the lens fragments through the probe.
                                        Once the cataract and all lens particles are removed, an Intraocular Lens Implant (IOL) is carefully placed inside the lens capsule. The IOL is securely held in place by the remaining back portion (posterior capsule) of the natural lens.
                                        This artificial lens takes over the function of your natural lens, restoring clear vision.
